# Project Motivation
We are provided with  Stack Overflow data from 2017 which captures survey of multitude of users from all around the world. Using these data I was tasked to ask three questions about the data and find the answers using CRISP-DM process.

1) How does the salary vary among people who are looking out?
2) Is there a difference in job satisfaction across the countries?
3) What are the most important factors for employed people which come into consideration while applying for jobs?

# Data
The data is Stackoverflow survey results for 2017. Link: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

# Approach
We are using CRISP_DM process to solve the problem:This invlolves below major steps:
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modelling
- Results
- Conclusion

# File Descriptions

1) Stackoverflow.ipynb: juypter notebook with the implementation for the project
2) Stackoverflow.html: html version of the notebook

# Packages
seaborn matplotlib numpy pandas sklearn

# Results
The answers can be seen either on the Jupyter notebook or on this blog: https://medium.com/@gchauhan.blr/crisp-dm-mine-the-unknown-823990a90239

# Conclusion
In this project we applied CRISP_DM process to mine information which is not obvious from raw dataset. We defined three questions that we were curious about and mined the answers using CRIPS_DM methodology from our dataset.It is amazing to see how data throws the Information out with minor twists. This is a must have skill for all the aspiring Data Scientists!
